* Lispeln
-1. Zischlaute fehlerhaft aussprechen, mit der Zunge ansto√üen.
-2. A rusty Scheme compiler.
** Why
Lispeln is a personal project to write a compiler for lisp, while learning [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] which is essentially an interpreter environment for Emacs Lisp. I find this reflection to be particularly satisfying, hence why I chose this project to get started in the emacs environment.

** How
Rust is my current go-to language for large-scale projects like this. I'll be referring to various sources for information on how to proceed, as well as learning Scheme along the way. I'll list anything I use in this manner below, under References.
